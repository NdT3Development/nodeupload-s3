# NodeUpload S3

NodeUpload S3 is a version of NodeUpload that allows you to use S3 to store files.

###### (Yeah, not the best name but I can't think of good names)
Decided to start from scratch using a different dependency for uploading. Basics are working and I think it is ready for running in a production environment.

## Installing
Should be easy to install and use

```sh
npm install
nano config.json # Configure NodeUpload (you can use something other than nano for this)
node createUser.js # This is the script for creating users
node app.js
```

## Configuration

Rename `config.json.example` to `config.json` and then modify the settings as required:

{
	"filenameLength": 10,
	"port": "8099",
	"indexForm": true,
	"indexFormDisabledMessage": "Hi, this is NodeUpload. The upload form here has been disabled. Change the config file to enable it.",
	"extBlacklist": [".exe", ".sh", ".cmd", ".bat", ".html", ".htm"],
	"ratelimitAfter": 5,
	"ratelimitTime": 7500,
	"logs": {
		"enable": false,
		"dir": "logs",
		"file": "NodeUpload_log.txt",
		"format": "{{ time }} | {{ log }} \n"
	},
	"s3": {
		"bucket": "",
		"s3_endpoint": "",
		"s3_accessKeyId": "",
		"s3_secretAccessKey": "",
		"s3_region": "",
		"remotePath": "",
		"redirectToAfterUpload": ""
	}
}

| ratelimitAfter | After this many requests in the `ratelimitTime`, rate limit requests | [x] |
| ratelimitTime | See `ratelimitAfter` description | [x] |
| logs.enable | If logs are enabled | [x] |
| logs.dir | The directory that logs will be saved in | []* |

| logs.format | Log format | [x] |
| s3.bucket | S3 bucket | [x] |
| s3.s3_endpoint | S3 endpoint | [x] |

| s3.s3_secretAccessKey | S3 secret key | [x] |
| s3.s3_region | S3 region | [x] |
| s3.remotePath | If you want the files to be uploaded to a different folder on S3 | [] |
| s3.redirectToAfterUpload | If you want users to be redirected to the URL of their file, insert that URL here | [] |

* These are required if `logs.enable` is set to `true`

## Creating a New User
After you are done installing and your friends also want to upload files, run the following command and answer the questions.

```sh
node createUser.js
```

## Usage

If the server is not already started, run `node app.js`.
Once the server has started, open a web browser to `YOUR_IP:PORT` (where `PORT` is the port specified in the config file (`config.json`)).

If everything worked, it should show an upload form (unless disabled in the config file). Just add your token where it says `Token`, choose a file to upload, then click the button. It should upload. If not, check the console for errors. You may need to open an issue here.

![Usage GIF](docs/assets/img/usage.gif)

Some file extensions are blacklisted by default. These can be changed in the config file.
- .exe
- .html
- .htm
- .bat
- .cmd
- .sh

## FAQs

  > What is this?

  NodeUpload is a Node.js server application that lets you run your own private file upload service. It uses randomly generated tokens for upload authentication.

  > Does it have support for ShareX?

  Yes it does! Please look at [the ShareX section of the docs](https://nodeupload.ndt3.me/#sharex-configuration) for more details.

  > How are uploads done?

  When a user uploads a file, it will be stored in a directory in your operating system's temp directory. Then there will be a connection to the database to check that the token is valid. If it is valid, the file gets moved to the `files` directory in the app's directory.

  > How are tokens generated?

  Tokens generated are not based on any information given when running `createUser.js`. The information there is only used to be stored in the database. The token is generated by the [`uuid` module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) (`uuid/v4`) to generate a completely random token.

  > Does it check for information already existing in the database when running `createUser.js`?

  Yes, this feature has been added.

  > Is there any way to change the port that it runs on?

  To change the port that NodeUpload runs on, edit the config file (`config.json`).

  > Is there any way to change the length of the generated file names of uploads?

  To change the length of the auto generated file names of uploads, edit the config file (`config.json`).

  > Is there any way to change the responses (console output, web responses, etc.)?

  Yes, there is. Edit the `strings.json` file. The placeholders (`{{placeholder}}`) in these cannot be used in all strings. The code will have to be changed if you want to add these into strings that do not have support for it. Note that not all strings can be changed. Please see [the docs](https://nodeupload.ndt3.me) for more details.

  > Can I contribute to the development of NodeUpload by opening pull requests?

  Yes, you can open a pull request but please use the format [here](https://github.com/NdT3Development/nodeupload/blob/master/PULL_REQUESTS.md)

  > I found a bug, how do I report it?

  > Can I request a feature?

  Yes, I am open to feedback and feature requests. Just open an issue using the format [here](https://github.com/NdT3Development/nodeupload/blob/master/FEATURE_REQUESTS.md)
